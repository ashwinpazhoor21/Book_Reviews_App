# Book Review App

Description of Project:  
My project, part of a Harvard course, consists of 15 essential files:

	•	”pycache”: Generated automatically when running the project with flask run.
	•	”.vscode”: Configures settings for Visual Studio Code.
	•	Flask Session Files: Integrate Flask, allowing the app to run locally.
	•	“templates” Folder: Contains all HTML files used in the application.
	•	“application.py”: The core script that drives the entire program.
	•	“application.pyc”: Supports the main script, providing error handling and requirement verification.
	•	“books.csv”: A comprehensive database of over 5,000 books, enabling searches by ISBN, author, or title.
	•	“helpers.py”: Retrieves Goodreads reviews, directly displayed on the book pages within the site.
	•	“helpers.pyc”: The output file generated from running the program.
	•	“import.py”: Manages the import of book data, powering the search functionality.
	•	“Procfile”: Guides Heroku in running the application and setting the appropriate port.
	•	“requirements.txt”: Specifies all necessary dependencies for the project.

Reflection:
Through this project, I have gained invaluable hands-on experience in web development and database management. I’ve learned how to integrate various technologies such as Flask, configure development environments with Visual Studio Code, and deploy applications using Heroku. Additionally, working with large datasets, like the book database in “books.csv,” has honed my data handling and search functionality implementation skills.

This project has not only deepened my technical knowledge but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities as I navigated through challenges and learned to optimize the application’s performance. Overall, it has been a fulfilling learning experience that has solidified my understanding of building and deploying full-stack web applications.
