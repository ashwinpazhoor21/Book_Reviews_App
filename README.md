# Project 1: Books

Description of Project: In my project I have a total of 15 Files. In the files there is at the top a "_pycache_" file this was created when I ran the project using the flask run command. The ".vs code" File is the file used to set the settings on how the program runs with my code editor "Visual Studio Code". The flask session files are there to import flask into my application and to help it run using the command "flask run" on the local host. The "templates" folder is used to store all the html files in my python application. I used all of these files to link into to the "application.py" file which contains the entire program. Next, the "application.py" file which is the main file of the entire program this is the file where I run it in the terminal and I can use the application on the local host. The "application.pyc" file is the file which helps the "application.py" file run it gives the error messages and it is the one that checks for the requirments. The "books.csv" file is the file which holds the database of the entire book search. From this the search engine can check if the user is searching for a book with the isbn, author, or the name itself. There are over 5,000 books in the entire file which was provided at the start with the sample project. The "helpers.py" file is the one that gets the goodreads review, and then when a user searches on my website for a book they can see the review on the bookpage from my website and not have to go search for it. The helpers.pyc is the output file from running the program. Then, the "import.py" file is the file that imports all the books from the "books.csv" file and it makes the search engine on the website work. The Procfile, is the file which helps heroku understand how to run the program and it helps to detmerine the port of the program when importing. Without this file the app would not run on heroku. Last but not least we have the "requirements.txt" file which helps the program know which are the requirements needed to run the program. To conclude, this is the description of my project and all the files in it.
